## [0.4.33] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Claude Code Session Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of Claude Code sessions via hooks. When Claude Code is running, ClaudeBar shows session status directly in the menu bar and popover:
  - **Menu bar indicator**: A terminal icon appears next to the quota icon with phase-colored status (green = active, blue = subagents working, orange = stopped)
  - **Session card**: Detailed session info in the popover showing phase, task count, active subagents, duration, and working directory
  - **System notifications**: Get notified when a session starts ("Claude Code Started") and finishes ("Claude Code Finished — Completed 3 tasks in 2m 5s")

## [0.3.12] - 2026-01-20

### Changed
- **Background Sync Disabled by Default**: Background sync is now disabled by default. Each Claude CLI spawn triggers a warmup session (even with zero prompts), and frequent background syncs can cause these sessions to stack up. The Claude Code team has addressed this in recent versions, so if you've updated to the latest Claude CLI, you can safely re-enable background sync in Settings → Background Sync.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **SwiftTerm Integration**: Added SwiftTerm terminal emulator library to properly render Claude CLI output. This fixes parsing issues with Claude Code v2.1.4+ which uses advanced terminal UI with cursor movements that previously corrupted captured output.

### Improved
- **Simplified Parsing**: Removed complex fuzzy matching and cursor movement heuristics. Terminal output is now properly rendered before parsing, producing clean text like a real terminal display.
- **Better Quota Accuracy**: Terminal rendering ensures "Current session" and other quota labels are parsed correctly even when the CLI uses cursor positioning to redraw the screen.

### Fixed
- **Sonnet Quota Display**: Fixed "Current week (Sonnet only)" being incorrectly labeled as "Opus" in the quota display. Sonnet and Opus quotas are now tracked and displayed separately.
- **Null Character Handling**: Fixed terminal buffer extraction to properly handle null characters from empty cells, which caused extracted text to include invisible padding.

### Technical
- Added SwiftTerm dependency (1.2.0+) for VT100/Xterm terminal emulation
- Created `TerminalRenderer` utility in `Sources/Infrastructure/Adapters/` that handles cursor movements, screen clearing, and ANSI escape sequences
- Replaced `stripANSICodes()` in `ClaudeUsageProbe` with `renderTerminalOutput()` using SwiftTerm
- Updated `Project.swift` to include SwiftTerm in Infrastructure target for Tuist builds
- Removed fuzzy regex matching (`matchesFuzzy`) - no longer needed with proper terminal rendering

## [0.3.4] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- **Background Sync**: Your quota data now syncs automatically in the background, so it's always fresh when you open the menu. No more waiting! Configure sync intervals (30s, 1min, 2min, or 5min) in Settings → Background Sync.
- **Fresh App Logo**: Updated app icon with a refreshed design.

### Improved
- **Better CLI Detection**: Fixed issues finding Claude, Codex, and other CLI tools on systems with custom shell configurations. The app now uses your login shell to properly resolve PATH ([#45](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/45)).

### Fixed
